## Experience

**Skypilot** San Mateo  
*Developer* | June 2025 - Present

- Worked on an open source project with over 8k Github stars used in production by multiple unicorn startups
- Improved code quality, memory efficiency, and performance of critical path components allowing for better scaling of provisioned virtual machines

**CS 162 Course Staff** Berkeley  
*Teaching Assistant* | Jan 2025 - Dec 2025

- Developing a curriculum update and teaching the fundamentals of operating system design and implementation to students
- Debugging 300 students code during office hours and teaching a class of 32 students in discussion

**Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)** Berkeley  
*Researcher* | Jan 2025 - Present

- Working on XQuant, a novel KV cache quantization method focusing on dynamically recomputing elements to minimize data movement
- Working on SqueezedAttention, a method to lower the amount of unneeded elements loaded from the KV cache

**Sky Computing Lab - LMSYS** Berkeley  
*Researcher* | Oct 2024 - June 2025

- Working on Chatbot Arena, making the server more reliable and expandable with Postgres SQL. Focusing on getting maximum data from user votes on LLM performance and ensuring fair use of models
- Creating Webdev Arena, an app that generates websites from a description and collects votes creating a ranking of ML models. Over 100 thousand votes logged

**Machine Learning at Berkeley** Berkeley  
*Education Officer* | August 2023 - Present

- Worked with Arcus Power, creating an LLM to summarize power timeseries data which is currently used daily in production
- Worked with a team on detecting ChatGPT (and other AI) generated content. Ended with 92% accuracy, gaining a silver medal on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/leaderboard) (34/4484) submissions

**NASA Ames** Santa Clara  
*Research Intern* | Jun 2021 - Aug 2021

- Worked on SafeDNN project exploring new techniques and tools to ensure that systems that use Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are safe, robust and interpretable resulting in a published paper

## Projects

**[Wordle Solver](https://github.com/lucamanolache/wordle)** | 2023
- Created a parallel algorithm in Rust for solving the Wordle by maximizing information gained with each guess. Averages solutions in 3 guesses

**Python Compiler** | 2024
- Created an optimized compiler for a typed subset of Python to RISC-V assembly using Flex/Java CUP for lexing/parsing

**Pipelined RISC-V CPU** | 2024
- Created a RISC-V CPU in Verilog optimized for FPGA with a 3 stage pipeline (fetch/decode, execution, writeback) and branch prediction

**Operating System** | 2024
- Created an functioning operating system from scratch. Added proper process control, syncronization, scheduling, and a file system
